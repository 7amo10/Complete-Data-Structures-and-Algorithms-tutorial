### Why do we need Stack?

To regulate methods of insertion and ...etc on data like **Back Button on Browser**

### Stack Operations
- Create Stack
- Push => for inserting elements
- Pop => for removing the last element from stack
- Peek => for returning the last element but not removing it
- isEmpty => checks if the stack is empty or not
- isFull => checks if the stack is full or not
- deleteStack => delete the stack

### Stack Creation - Array vs Linked List
Stack using Array
- Easy to implement
- Fixed-size

Stack using Linked List
- Variable size
- Implementation is not easy

### First: Stack using **Array**

All basic operations of Stack using Array are implemented very easily and don't need to be illustrated. 

### Time and Space Complexity:

### Second: Stack using **LinkedList**

As you can see these are all that you need for the concept of Stack basic operations using LinkedList

So, what about when to use Stack or avoid it?

To practice on the Binary Tree topic:
Stack_Array.java and its main file => holds all basic operations of Stack using Array
Node, LinkedList, StackLinkedList, and its main => all contain basic operations of Stack using LinkedList

For having exercises:
Stack.java => holds basic operations that are implemented in different manner using Array
Exercise.java and its main file => hold a specific application on Stack

Feel free when you open this README file to read or listen for a good tutorial for this topic then review this article and finally try with the questions.
