## About The Projectâœ¨âœŠ



This course is designed to help you to achieve your career goals. Whether you are looking to get more into Data Structures and Algorithms, increase your learning potential, or just want a job with more freedom, this is the right course for you!

## Getting Started

In this Repo Course, you can begin with the education links below and browse various courses before going into the practical implementation that I attached. 

### Prerequisites

First, you need to know about basic programming language principles like loops, functions,...etc. Second, studying OOP very well.
- Note that any programming language doesn't matter if you know the basic prerequisites above with C++ for example go to the coding tutorial.


## After finishing this tutorial, you will be able to:

- [x] Learn basic algorithmic techniques such as greedy algorithms, binary search, sorting, and dynamic programming.
- [x] Learn the strengths and weaknesses of a variety of data structures, so you can choose the best data structure for your data and applications
- [x] Learn many of the algorithms commonly used to sort data, so your applications will perform efficiently when sorting large datasets
- [x] Learn how to apply graph and string algorithms to solve real-world challenges: finding shortest paths on huge maps and assembling genomes from millions of pieces. 


We continue our commitment to improving and expanding the capabilities of makeread. me to provide an efficient and seamless readme generation experience to our users.
