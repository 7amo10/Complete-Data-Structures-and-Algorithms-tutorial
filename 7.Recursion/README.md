# Fast cover on Recursion for this tutorial
###

Here in this topic Recursion is so important to learn as it is used for various problems that needs to break down 
into smaller sub problem.

In this picture you can understand the logic behind Recursion:

As you can see when the method passed with a parameter, it repeat itself one more time till reach the **base condition**

So, when you open the coding files you will find **factorial** and **fibonacci** examples for understanding the concept.

Take **fibonacci** as an example and first look into this picture:

As you can see the concept is based on how to deel with multiple calls and when you put for example 4 and pass it to
the method it calls the number before the main number (n-1) and then the number before (n-2) after that combine all these 
nodes as the picture.

Remember that the files are named with its description 
- files with Mainetc is the concept explanation
- files with the name of problems

Feel free and when you open this README file read or listen for a good tutorial for this topic then review on this article
and finnaly try with the questions.
